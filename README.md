	Environmental Impact Tableau Dashboard

Goal
- Visualize Environmental Metrics: Provide an interactive view of key environmental metrics such as carbon emissions, water consumption, energy usage, and waste generated.
- Compare Across Dimensions: Enable comparisons across regions, industries, product types, and compliance levels.
- Monitor Trends: Display trends over time to identify patterns and opportunities for improvement.
- Enhance Decision-Making: Support strategic decisions to improve environmental compliance and reduce negative impact.

Skills Demonstrated
1.	SQL Data Analysis: Proficient use of AVG, GROUP BY, COUNT, and other aggregate functions to analyze trends and relationships within large datasets.
2.	Critical Thinking & Problem Solving: Designing queries and interpreting results to derive meaningful conclusions about agricultural outcomes.

Tools & Technologies Used
1.	SQL: For querying the dataset and calculating metrics such as average yields, disease impact, and irrigation effectiveness.
2.	GitHub: Showcasing project outcomes in a professional portfolio for enhanced visibility.

Key Insights & Results
1.	Data Visualization with Tableau
o	Created a multi-chart interactive dashboard using Tableau Public Edition.
o	Used various chart types: donut chart, line chart, bar chart, heatmap, and scatter plot.
o	Applied consistent design and color scheme for better visual storytelling.

2.	Interactive Filters & User Controls
o	Implemented filters for Year, Industry, Product Type, Region, and Compliance Level to allow dynamic exploration of the data.


3.	KPI Indicator Cards
o	Highlighted key metrics using summary cards:
	Total Energy Usage (37.5M)
	Average Recycling Rate (72.02%)
	Total Carbon Emissions (16.2M)
	Total Water Consumption (49.9M)

4.	Trend Analysis
o	Used a line graph to display energy usage trends from 2020 to 2024.
5.	Correlation Analysis
o	Displayed relationship between Carbon Emissions and Recycling Rates using a scatter plot to evaluate potential trends.
6.	Regional and Industrial Comparison
o	Employed a heatmap to compare Recycling Rates across industries and regions.
o	Used a bar chart to compare Carbon Emissions by Region.
7.	Effective Layout and UX Design
o	Organized visuals cleanly for readability.
o	Incorporated tooltips and labels for data clarity.

Key Insights & Results
1.	Energy Usage Trends
o	Energy usage peaked sharply in 2022 (~2.1M) but significantly dropped in 2023 and 2024.
o	Suggests successful implementation of energy-saving measures post-2022.
2.	Recycling Performance
o	The Average Recycling Rate is relatively high at 72.02%, indicating good environmental practices overall.
o	North America and Australia show the highest industry recycling rates (above 79%).
3.	Carbon Emissions Analysis
o	Asia has the highest total carbon emissions (~23.5M kg), followed closely by North America.
o	Despite high recycling rates, emissions are still high, suggesting other contributing factors (like industrial scale).
4.	Compliance Distribution
o	Compliance levels are evenly distributed across three levels, with ~33% each, indicating diverse environmental adherence.
5.	Industry-Wise Performance
o	Energy and Mining industries show relatively lower recycling rates in regions like Africa and Middle East.
o	Textiles show highly variable recycling rates, suggesting inconsistent practices across regions.
6.	Relationship Between Emissions and Recycling
o	Scatter plot shows that high recycling rates don’t always correspond with low emissions — suggesting the need for deeper analysis.
